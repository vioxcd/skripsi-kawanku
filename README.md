# Skripsi Kawanku

I've helped several friends work on their bachelor's thesis throughout the last several years by various means.

In this repo, I'd like to share some of the most recent ones that I've got access to the code for and felt like I have some deal in doing the code.

Why am I sharing this? Well, sometimes when I'm doing retrospective, I tend to think about how my development seems not to be as fast as other people, and I tend to forget that I've spent a great deal of my time helping others doing these kinds of things â€” the work that matters, but easily escapes scrutiny. I don't intend to take credit for the project or the code, that's not what this repo is about. Once again, it's for reminding myself that I did some of these things, and these are good things I tend to forget.

## What's here

The project I worked on was mostly beginner-level stuff, but I think they're okay enough to be called a project.

It mostly covers machine learning techniques, like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition, association rules, single-label classification, and multi-label classification.

My involvement vary from project to project. sometimes I get the data from a source through scraping or API calls (or stream), other times I help clean the data or create features, to modeling, tuning, and testing. There's also this one time when I help build a website for visualizations along with elasticsearch integration for it.

In all of those cases, I got the opportunity to learn a bit about the subject.

Anyway, what's in this repo is:

- [Scraping Kompas.com][Mirul Kompas] (news site)
- [Scraping Tribun and CNN][Ulin Scraping] (news site)
- [Cleaning Tribun and CNN data][Ulin Cleaning]
- [Streaming Twitter and EDA of tweets dataset][Jims Mlaju]
- [Sentiment Analysis using bitcoin dataset][Jims Cleaning] (mostly cleaning the data)
- [Conditional Random Fields][Widi CLI] (create cli tools to interact with the model)
- [Multilabel Classification][Thor Modeling] (comparing KNN, SVM, and MLP performance)
